			<h2> Information on Project</h2>
			<p>
				This is a racing game that up to 4 people can play. This game was made in 5 weeks with a group of 4 people. On this project I was the lead of the game. I made sure people did their work, when they got their work in I made sure that the game still worked after inplementing new code and if it did break I would go in and fix whatever bug would appear. I would also fill in and do anything that would need to be done. I was made the model of the car that is used in this game. Maya 2016 and Unity was used.
